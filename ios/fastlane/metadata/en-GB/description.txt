For us, ‘Pride in London’ is about coming together to celebrate and acknowledge the diversity of LGBT+ people in this city. We created an app to help you plan your perfect Pride experience, to make new friends, and to try something new at events organised by the full spectrum of LGBT+ people throughout the Pride season.

DISCOVER PRIDE EVENTS
Explore, buy tickets and get directions to Pride Festival events during the two weeks leading up to the big day itself. On the day you’ll be able to find stages easily through our map, with a full lineup of who’s performing and when.

MAKE YOUR PRIDE PERFECT
Heart events that you’re interested in attending to get your very own Pride schedule to keep track of what’s coming up that you like. You can easily share events with friends too so you can enjoy them together.

DISCOVER THE LOVE THAT HAPPENS IN LONDON
We’ve pinned stories of important personal moments from hundreds of LGBT Londoners to prove that love is everywhere in our city. Check ‘em out.

EXPLORE PARADE GROUPS
It’s easier than ever to find that sports group you wanted to join or that charity you wanted to find out more about. Browse, filter and learn more about all of the groups marching in the parade.

OFFLINE ACCESS
We know that signal can be poor around Soho on the day, so we made sure that all the information is available offline on your phone at any time. Yay!

GOT FEEDBACK?
We created this app based entirely on comments and suggestions from Pride goers in 2016. Make sure to send is some feedback by emailing app@prideinlondon.org so that we can make 2018’s app bigger and better than ever.
